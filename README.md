Proxymaster is a Fork of PluralKit, aimed at specifically DID/OSDD-1 systems. It is not meant to be exclusionary and it is not a cause of syscourse. It is simply meant to give something to the community that has been missing since the retirement of SystemTime!

I take no ownership of the code written by xSke for the PluralKit bot.
