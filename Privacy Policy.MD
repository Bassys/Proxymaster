**Privacy Policy**

Data collected by Proxymaster:
* Data given to the bot (such as User IDs, Member Info like descriptions & displaynames, Group Names, etc.)
-> This extends to Guild Specific Information such as Guild Specific Usernames and Autoproxy Status e.g., because otherwise there would be no way to store the information between restarts, as it would reset every time
* Metadata of Guilds and Messages (like Message IDs, Guild IDs, and Channel IDs)
* Webhook IDs, including the Guild
* Event IDs of actions (like created messages or logged switches, e.g., among the IDs of every other action)
* Metrics about the total integers of the bot, such as total member count and server count which can be viewed via `pm!stats`, distributed completely anonymously

Data not collected by Proxymaster:
* Message Contents and Data
* Any Information about messages not proxied by Proxymaster
* Information about the Guild that Proxymaster does not need to know, including Channels, Members, and Other Webhooks
* Usernames, Guild Names, and Channel Names
* Any data removed from the bot (such as deleted Members, Systems, or Switches)

`All of the data collected is also logged onto our laptop, as is other actions by the bot, including error messages and stats. At any point you can ask for me to remove your data from the logs.`

**Other Important Things To Note**

* The only person that have access to your data in the database is me. No one else has the password or access to my laptop.
* All of the information you give to the bot is automatically privated via the bots internal privacy, which means other users cannot look up your information without you knowing
-> If you make your data public then your data is public via your own accord and I do not take responsibility for what other Users might or might not do with it. I do not recommend ever giving out your full system list or the system.json file
* If any more concerns or questions arise you can ask me here on GitHub or you can either DM me on Discord at `@Mushroom Kingdom#8404` or open a ticket/ask publically in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/NMcsKRvpns)
* I do not check the database or logs to look at User Data or System Information, nor do I edit the data without User Request
-> For any inquiries about your data and possible changes to it (including System and Member IDs) you can contact me through the same way as above
* The logs do not stay on my laptop indefinitely and I delete ones that are older than the current month
